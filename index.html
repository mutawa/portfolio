                    <section>
                        <p>
                            MSX is my favorite computer and my first one at that. 
                            My father bought me one when I was 14 years old.
                            That was back in 1991.
                        </p>
                        <h5>From Wikipedia</h5>
                        <p>
                            MSX is a standardized home computer architecture, announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983. It was conceived and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then vice-president at Microsoft Japan and director at ASCII Corporation. Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period.

                    <h3>Z80 Assembly</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want to write any commercial software for the MSX platform, then Z80 assembly is the only viable language to write it in. Although MSX can support BASIC language, it is not a good user experience for the end-user since it is a lot slower than machine language.

                        <h3>SQLite</h3>
                        <p>
                            SQLite is a database engine with near-full capabilities as any major database engines (such as Oracle, MySql, Microsoft SQL), but it has an advantage over all of these examples. It requires no oversized installation libraries to be installed on the device. It only requires a very small engine library, usually a single file, and the database file itself.

                        <h3>D3js</h3>
                        <p>
                            D3js is a javascript library that makes building dynamic charts very easy and robust experience. In my opinion, it should have been called D4 for (Dynamic-Data-Driven-Documents). The concept is amazing and I have already adopted the library in most of my projects.
