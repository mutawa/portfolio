# Ahmad's Portfolio
This repository is meant to satisfy Udacity Front-End Nanodegree 1st Project.

## How to use
This portfolio is built as server-less static html files. So all you need is a browser that can view HTML5 documents. Latest (Chrome)[http://chrome.google.com] is recommended.

Just open `index.html` to view the portolio.


## Libraries used
I have decided to go with (Bootstrap)[https://getbootstrap.com] rather than re-inventing the wheel.
